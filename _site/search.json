This one makes us so flexible for getting updated data. For CSV method, it only reflects the time when we downloaded it and requires more manual cleaning to analyze it. To conclude, GtrendsR is better for reproducibility and fresh results, while CSV is better for consistency and sharing."

    "text": "In Teaching to See, Andrei Severny and Edward Tufte, building on the insights of Inge Druckrey, emphasize the art of truly learning how to observe visual form. One of the first lessons from Druckrey is the distinction between thin and thick, as well as curve and linearity. These contrasts are more than stylistic choices; they establish rhythm, balance, and structure in design. A thin line may suggest delicacy or subtlety, while a thick stroke conveys weight and emphasis. Similarly, curved forms add movement, grace, and fluidity, while linear elements ground a composition with stability and direction. Training the eye to perceive these subtle relationships develops sensitivity that is essential for effective visual communication.\nHolmes extended this idea by reflecting on the relationship between the eye and the hand in writing. He described the eye as the organ of selection and judgment, the part that perceives form, proportion, and harmony. The hand, in contrast, serves as the instrument of execution, translating visual thought into physical marks. Writing and drawing, therefore, require an intimate collaboration: the eye directs and evaluates, while the hand follows and shapes. This duality highlights that skill in design is not just manual dexterity, but also cultivated vision.\nThe influence of such training can be seen in modern technology. Steve Jobs often credited a college calligraphy course for shaping his design sensibility and inspiring the Macintosh computer’s typographic elegance. Calligraphy taught him the beauty of proportion, spacing, and detail, which later translated into Apple’s groundbreaking use of digital fonts and aesthetically refined interfaces. For Jobs, calligraphy represented the fusion of art and technology—a philosophy that made Apple products not only functional but also visually compelling and deeply human-centered.\nA final lesson from Druckrey and Tufte concerns the difference between geometric accuracy and optical accuracy. Geometric accuracy refers to strict mathematical precision—perfect circles, exact squares, or measurable alignments. Yet, design that is only geometrically correct can often feel awkward to the human eye. Optical accuracy, by contrast, adapts form to perception. In typography, for example, curved letters like “O” often extend slightly beyond a baseline so that they appear equal in size to straight letters, even though they are not geometrically identical. This principle reflects a core truth: design is judged not by mathematical rules alone but by how forms are perceived in real experience.\nIn sum, Teaching to See underscores that design begins with perception, sharpened through attention to contrast, balance, and the collaboration of eye and hand. From Druckrey’s lessons on thin and thick to Jobs’ appreciation for calligraphy, the text reminds us that clarity, elegance, and human perception matter more than mechanical precision. Seeing, in this sense, is not a passive act but an active discipline that shapes the way we create and communicate in the visual world."
